Morse code decryption is the process of converting a sequence of dots and 
dashes, which represent letters, numbers, and symbols, back into the original
text message.

To decrypt a Morse code message, you can create a dictionary that maps the dots
and dashes to letters, numbers and symbols. Then, you can iterate over the encoded
message and use the dictionary to look up the corresponding character for each 
sequence of dots and dashes.
